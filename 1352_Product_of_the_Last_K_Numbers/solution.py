    This class is designed to keep track of the product of numbers that are added.

    - add(num): Adds a number to the list and keeps track of the cumulative product.
    - getProduct(k): Returns the product of the last k numbers added (not including 0).

    - size: An integer that keeps track of the number of elements added to the list.
