def minSwaps(s):
	"""
	:type s: str
	:rtype: int
	
	This function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to 
	balance a string of brackets containing '[' and ']'.
	
	The function uses a stack to track the unmatched '[' characters 
	and a counter to track unmatched ']' characters. The final result 
	is calculated based on the number of unmatched ']' characters.

	:param s: A string consisting of '[' and ']' characters
	:return: Minimum number of swaps needed to balance the brackets
	"""
	stk = []  # Stack to hold unmatched '[' characters
	ub = 0    # Unmatched ']' counter
	
	for ch in s:
		if ch == "[":
			stk.append(ch)  # Push unmatched '[' onto the stack
		else:
			if stk:
				stk.pop()  # Match ']' with an unmatched '['
			else:
				ub += 1  # Increment unmatched ']' counter if no '[' is available
	
	# Each unmatched ']' indicates the need for a swap to create a matching '['
	# To balance two unmatched characters, we need one swap. Hence, we divide by 2.
	return (ub + 1) // 2
