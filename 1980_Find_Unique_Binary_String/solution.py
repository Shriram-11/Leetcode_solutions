def findDifferentBinaryString(nums):
	"""
	Find a binary string that is not in the given list of binary strings.

	This function generates a binary string of the same length as the input list,
	such that it differs from each string in the input list at least at one position.
	The approach used is to take advantage of the fact that if we generate a binary 
	string by inverting each bit at the corresponding position in the input list, 
	the resulting string will differ from every string in the list.

	:type nums: List[str]
	:param nums: A list of binary strings of length `n`.

	:rtype: str
	:return: A binary string of length `n` that is not present in the list `nums`.

	res = ""  # Initialize an empty result string
	
	# Iterate through each string in the input list `nums`
	for i in range(len(nums)):
		# If the character at position i in nums[i] is '0', append '1' to the result string.
		# If it's '1', append '0' to the result string.
